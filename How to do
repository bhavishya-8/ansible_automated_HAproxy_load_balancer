Hello everyone,
This is a ansible automated haproxy loadbalancer project, which will help in scale out and scale in automatically with the help of Ansible tool.
To avoide the confusion and for the beginners, this is a best kind of project.

What exact is going to happen in this project and how to do it?

-> In this project, we are working on the ansible installed computer which is also called ansible controller node and we have three other managed node including two server and one loadbalancer.
-> All the files you can see in this repository, are working on the top of your ansible controller node and the host file is nothing but the host file of ansible which is present at /etc/ansible/
-> Now as you run the ansible playbook web.yml, all the managed nodes will get ready as PHP server.
-> Also when you run the lb.yml which is the playbook for the loadbalancer managed node, your load balancer will also get ready on the port number 8080.

Now, your loadbalance is ready to work and the load of the client request is now divided on all the server node.


**Things to remember:
-> This project is tested on AWS cloud.
-> Please do not forgot to update the host file with the public IPs of the instances.
-> Put the IP of the loadbalance in the [lb] group and put the all the IPs of the server computer under the [web] group.
-> You can add as many server you want to balance the load by adding the IPs of the nodes under the host file of ansible but you can add only one loadbalancer.
-> Make sure that all the managed ansible nodes can be connected through SSH protocol to the controller node of ansible.
